        1968 was a tumultuous year, and the 1968 Olympics Games was a tumultuous athletic event. Hosted in Mexico City from October 12 to October 27, the 1968 Games saw records broken, protests take place and emotional battles play out between countries. Photographers helped document these moments, and the stories behind their coverage help make an important year for the Olympics even more interesting.

        Before the competition even started, the stage was set for a tense Olympic Games. That year, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. The American public was divided on its participation in the Vietnam War. In 1968 alone, more than 16,000 U.S. soldiers died, making it the war’s deadliest year. Internationally, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. Not to mention that the 1968 Olympics were the first Games to be held in Latin America or in a Spanish-speaking country. Even the location was controversial, as Mexico City’s high altitude of 2,300 meters proved to be difficult for athletes in endurance-based events. All this culminated in an international gathering fit for the history books, and photographers were there to capture that history.
